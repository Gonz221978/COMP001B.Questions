            <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
            <p>The only changes to the course I would consider having would be to give a specific title names for each assignment part. However, that is hardly an issue.</p>

            <p>When attempting to complete my COMP001A final I delved into some concepts we learned in this course. I had encountered basic HTML and CSS before but I deepened my understanding during this course.</p>
